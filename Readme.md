# Video Call and Conference Feature with Zegocloud API

## Introduction

This project demonstrates the integration of Zegocloud's API to implement a real-time video call and conference feature in a Next.js project using the T3 Stack. Zegocloud provides a robust solution for embedding video and audio communication capabilities into web applications.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed
- Zegocloud API key (Sign up and obtain your key [here](https://www.zego.im))

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   ```bash
   npm install next react react-dom @emotion/react @emotion/styled zego-express-engine
   ```


3. **Create a `.env.local` file:**

   Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and add your Zegocloud API key:

   ```dotenv
   ZEGO_API_KEY=your_zego_api_key
   ```

   Replace `your_zego_api_key` with your actual API key.

## Usage
